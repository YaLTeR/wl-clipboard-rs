//! Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version

//! interface names are removed and the interface version number is

    <span class="doccomment">//! Wayland protocol for graphics tablets
    //!
    //! This description provides a high-level overview of the interplay between
    //! the interfaces defined this protocol. For details, see the protocol
    //! specification.
    //!
    //! More than one tablet may exist, and device-specifics matter. Tablets are
    //! not represented by a single virtual device like wl_pointer. A client
    //! binds to the tablet manager object which is just a proxy object. From
    //! that, the client requests wp_tablet_manager.get_tablet_seat(wl_seat)
    //! and that returns the actual interface that has all the tablets. With
    //! this indirection, we can avoid merging wp_tablet into the actual Wayland
    //! protocol, a long-term benefit.
    //!
    //! The wp_tablet_seat sends a &quot;tablet added&quot; event for each tablet
    //! connected. That event is followed by descriptive events about the
    //! hardware; currently that includes events for name, vid/pid and
    //! a wp_tablet.path event that describes a local path. This path can be
    //! used to uniquely identify a tablet or get more information through
    //! libwacom. Emulated or nested tablets can skip any of those, e.g. a
    //! virtual tablet may not have a vid/pid. The sequence of descriptive
    //! events is terminated by a wp_tablet.done event to signal that a client
    //! may now finalize any initialization for that tablet.
    //!
    //! Events from tablets require a tool in proximity. Tools are also managed
    //! by the tablet seat; a &quot;tool added&quot; event is sent whenever a tool is new
    //! to the compositor. That event is followed by a number of descriptive
    //! events about the hardware; currently that includes capabilities,
    //! hardware id and serial number, and tool type. Similar to the tablet
    //! interface, a wp_tablet_tool.done event is sent to terminate that initial
    //! sequence.
    //!
    //! Any event from a tool happens on the wp_tablet_tool interface. When the
    //! tool gets into proximity of the tablet, a proximity_in event is sent on
    //! the wp_tablet_tool interface, listing the tablet and the surface. That
    //! event is followed by a motion event with the coordinates. After that,
    //! it&#39;s the usual motion, axis, button, etc. events. The protocol&#39;s
    //! serialisation means events are grouped by wp_tablet_tool.frame events.
    //!
    //! Two special events (that don&#39;t exist in X) are down and up. They signal
    //! &quot;tip touching the surface&quot;. For tablets without real proximity
    //! detection, the sequence is: proximity_in, motion, down, frame.
    //!
    //! When the tool leaves proximity, a proximity_out event is sent. If any
    //! button is still down, a button release event is sent before this
    //! proximity event. These button events are sent in the same frame as the
    //! proximity event to signal to the client that the buttons were held when
    //! the tool left proximity.
    //!
    //! If the tool moves out of the surface but stays in proximity (i.e.
    //! between windows), compositor-specific grab policies apply. This usually
    //! means that the proximity-out is delayed until all buttons are released.
    //!
    //! Moving a tool physically from one tablet to the other has no real effect
    //! on the protocol, since we already have the tool object from the &quot;tool
    //! added&quot; event. All the information is already there and the proximity
    //! events on both tablets are all a client needs to reconstruct what
    //! happened.
    //!
    //! Some extra axes are normalized, i.e. the client knows the range as
    //! specified in the protocol (e.g. [0, 65535]), the granularity however is
    //! unknown. The current normalized axes are pressure, distance, and slider.
    //!
    //! Other extra axes are in physical units as specified in the protocol.
    //! The current extra axes with physical units are tilt, rotation and
    //! wheel rotation.
    //!
    //! Since tablets work independently of the pointer controlled by the mouse,
    //! the focus handling is independent too and controlled by proximity.
    //! The wp_tablet_tool.set_cursor request sets a tool-specific cursor.
    //! This cursor surface may be the same as the mouse cursor, and it may be
    //! the same across tools but it is possible to be more fine-grained. For
    //! example, a client may set different cursors for the pen and eraser.
    //!
    //! Tools are generally independent of tablets and it is
    //! compositor-specific policy when a tool can be removed. Common approaches
    //! will likely include some form of removing a tool when all tablets the
    //! tool was used on are removed.
